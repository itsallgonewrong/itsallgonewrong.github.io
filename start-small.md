    Start small, test early, learn fast
</div>

Start small and optimise for learning.  Give the team space to figure things out and test their riskiest assumptions. Deliver value quickly and continuously. Avoid false certainty.

By doing these thing you will able to:
- quickly respond to emerging challenges, needs and market changes.  
- reduce risk
- deliver value sooner

**A leader who starts small, tests and learns fast**
- Invests in understanding problems
- Identifies and tests their riskiest assumptions
- Seeks to deliver value early and often

# Tools and Techniques
## Start small and optimise for learning.  
Use the most efficient and low cost way to test if your ideas are working, do this from the start and use what you learn to inform what you do next. One way to cheaply test is to use **paper prototyping** as an early technique.

## Give the team space to figure things out and test their riskiest assumptions.

Use tools like **Assumptions mapping** to surface what assumptions you are making and which ones hold the most risk if they turn out to be incorrect. Using this technique will allow you to prioritise your assumptions and which you need to test early.

![Assumption Mapping Workshop, by David J Bland](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_E4D4F58BA57E4D4E9D6C549FE96C9D1381FFDC5A681A894E0B5D18BC84B58E3F_1677769192759_Screenshot+2023-03-02+at+14.59.38.png)

Assumptions mapping is a collaborative approach to help people and teams highlight their assumptions, theme them into feasible, desirable and viable options, then prioritise them by their importance and risk to ascertain which are the riskiest (or “leap of faith”) assumptions.

Know these early on allows teams test them, using cheap, quick, lean and agile approaches. By doing this team will be able to reduce the risk of project carrying assumptions that turn out to be wrong, and undermine the project.

## Avoid false certainty.
Encourage **Weeknotes** as a form of regular communication to keep up to date with what teams are learning, decisions they are making, progress against goals and anything upcoming that you should be aware of.

# Example
## Starting small and spreading fast at the Co-op
![Source: https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2018/04/26/co-designing-the-shifts-website](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_E4D4F58BA57E4D4E9D6C549FE96C9D1381FFDC5A681A894E0B5D18BC84B58E3F_1677769164156_Screenshot+2023-03-02+at+14.59.11.png)

Shifts is an application that people can access through the web.
There was a 3-week discovery to find out how to make life simpler for the around 40k people our people working in stores, one of those alphas was around store workers schedules.

### The challenge
For people in Co-op stores, to know what shift they’d been assigned or swapping them with colleagues was hard as shifts were pinned on the office wall, so they had to go in to see them.
The impact of that is that it made it hard for people to plan things like hospital appointment, caring duties or holidays, was hard and slow. 
Rescheduling or swapping shifts happens through informal channels like WhatsApp.

If colleagues could do these things independently, managers would be more free to spend time on things that would be more valuable to their colleagues and customers.

### The Approach
The team prototyped an online version of the schedules, originally called my schedule, and built it into a web prototype to see how users interacted with it.

They went from a paper prototype to people being able to see their shifts online
They then built it up to including features for checking their holiday balance and book holidays and managers such as approve holidays

### The Outcome
The ability to access your shift pattern from your phone was so useful that word about the early prototype spread (too) quickly. The prototype delivered value quickly.
Prototype released colleagues in 10 stores in September 2017. 
By November, 600 people across 120 stores were using it, spread by word of mouth.
By May 2018 we’ve had rolled it out to all stores and had 17,500 - 93% of stores / 65% of users 
£20 million saved in year 1

### Conclusion
They didn’t go straight into building the full app, It wouldn’t have worked like this…. Small, testing… learning.  Next most important thing

Outcomes first, means the team could be evolutionary
Testing early and cheaply lead to better results.
