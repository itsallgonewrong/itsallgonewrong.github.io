The BBC is undergoing a transformation to become a digital first organisation so it continues to provide value for its audiences while staying relevant in an increasingly on-demand world. Public Digital are supporting the BBC to embed user-centred, agile and iterative ways of working in practice.

We’re sharing our work in the open so that more people can see what we’re up to and what we are learning as we go. The BBC is a big organisation so by telling the stories about the small things we hope to bring more people together.
