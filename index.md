Designing and operating modern, internet-era services is different from what you might be used to, but it’s not rocket science. It’s the application of a few simple principles, a simple flow of work and some tweaked behaviours. 

This guide is designed to give you an introduction into these ways of working to support your onboarding into your new team.

## When we say Digital we mean…

When we say _digital_, _digital ways of working_, or _digital organisations_ we mean:

> “Applying the culture, processes, business models and technologies of the internet era to respond to people's raised expectations.”

When we say _digital first_ we are referring to (insert words here)

Every organisation is different but those adapting effectively to the internet-era demonstrate these characteristics.

### [Collaborate around outcomes over solutions](/outcomes-over-solutions.html)

> Tell your empowered teams what you need to achieve -  something everyone can relate to and get behind. Let them decide how to make it happen.

    Radically focus on users and their needs
</div>


### Radically focus on users and their needs

> Start with the user and work backwards.  Focus on the people who will be affected by your work, whose needs must be met to successfully deliver your outcome.

   Trust extraordinary (cross-functional) teams
</div>

### Trust extraordinary (cross-functional) teams

> Assemble teams from across BBC, no matter which department people usually work in. Give these new teams a problem and autonomy to solve it. Small, empowered teams work magic.

   Make space for creativity
</div>

### Make space for creativity

> Encourage a culture of experimentation. Create space for radical new ideas to be continuously discovered and developed. Involve everyone in innovation.

<div class="yellow">
    Start small, test early, learn fast
</div>


### [Start small, test early, learn fast](/start-small.html)

> Start small and optimise for learning.  Give the team space to figure things out and test their riskiest assumptions. Deliver value quickly and continuously. Avoid false certainty.
